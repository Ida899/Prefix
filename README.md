# Prefix
Some new Discord music in process... (In order to replace Poly!) FFMpeg, Discord.js, NPM, and Node used in project.
Prefix is the bot's name. Prefix's prefix (Strange I guess...) is ?p . With a space, so such as ?p help. 
I'm going to try to add a queue system if possible, and prefix changing features, moderation features and some 8 ball stuff!
